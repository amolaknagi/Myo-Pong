# Myo-Pong

I had an extra hour at PennApps and I had two choices. I could've either went to sleep to rest for the long week ahead, or I could have stayed awake, played around with a cool motion sensor, and quickly make an app for no reason. I think the choice is obvious. I used the Myo motion sensor's accurate rotation measurements to create a "Myo Pong" app with a retro theme. In this game, you play Pong against an undefeatable computer and live as long as possible to get a high score, and you control your character with the rotation of the Myo. The setup of the Myo through bluetooth is seamless, and the whole app should be a nice experience if you have the motion sensor. If I ever get more time I'd like to quickly add multiplayer with two Myos, though I'm not sure the Myo SDK allows this.
